# Repo for labs on combinatorial methods

## `lab1/` Combinations

Enumerate spanning trees for given complete graph on 4 vertices

Use TSL method (stands for transposition with left shift)

## `lab2/` Permutations

Enumerate all permutations of given `N` first natural numbers
via neighbouring elements transposition method. Note ones matching their reverse permutation.

## `lab3/` Transversals

Chose ones from a given matrix in a way that none of them has overlaping rows. Use Hall's algorithm for this problem

## `lab4/` Partitions of natural number

Enumerate all partitions of a given number `N` such that each contains at least one element greater or equal to given number `M`
